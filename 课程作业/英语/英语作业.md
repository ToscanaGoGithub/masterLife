    挂科是一个老师否定学生某一科目在本学期成果的手段。但我不认为挂科是老师激励学生的一个王牌。
    一方面，在我的朋友中，有些学生对某些科目并不是很感兴趣，或者不是很擅长，如果直接去用挂科来进行威胁，可能会导致一些出乎意料的结果，对于这些学生，应该予以理解，或者进行进一步的帮助，而不是进行一刀切。另一方面，挂科对于一些学生后果太过严重，而某些老师可能滥用这种权利，导致学生与老师之间地位的严重不平衡。影响之间本来和睦的师生关系。最后，对于很多学生来说，学业本身就有很大的压力，而如果老师以挂科为威胁，只会让学生有更大的压力，导致他们自杀等过激行为，例如最近的大连理工研究生自杀事件。
    总之，老师可以利用挂科去警告一些不认真对待学业的人，而不是作为一个正常使用的手段对待所有学生。

    Suspending subjects is a means by which a teacher denies a student's achievements in a certain subject during the semester. But I don't think that dropping a subject is a trump card for teachers to motivate students.
    On the one hand, among my friends, some students are not very interested in certain subjects, or are not very good at them. If they directly threaten to drop subjects, it may lead to some unexpected results. For these students, It should be understood, or further help, rather than one size fits all. On the other hand, the consequences of failing subjects are too serious for some students, and some teachers may abuse this right, resulting in a serious imbalance between the status of students and teachers. Affect the originally harmonious relationship between teachers and students. Finally, for many students, the academic work itself has a lot of pressure, and if the teacher threatens to drop a course, it will only put more pressure on the students, leading to suicide and other extreme behaviors, such as the recent suicide of a graduate student of Dalian University of Technology event.
    In short, the teacher can use the lapse of subjects to warn some people who do not take their studies seriously, instead of treating all students as a normal method.
