1、什么是标准BP算法？
主要是书上那个公式吧，主要是计算一个节点的误差，例如从输出层的结点去计算。
BP算法每次迭代都计算一个样本，最小化该样本输出值与真实值的差距，然后将修改过的参数传给下一个样本，直到达到收敛条件。这样做参数更新频繁，也可能出现参数更改相互抵消的情况，于是有了累积误差逆传播算法（ABP）。
ABP算法每次迭代都会先算出所有样本的输出，然后最小化整个样本输出与真实值的最小平方和，修改参数后进行下一次迭代。ABP参数更新次数比BP算法少的多，但是当累积误差降到一定程度时，进一步下降会非常缓慢。
迭代终止的条件：这里设置的终止条件是相邻一百次迭代的均方误差的差值不超过0.0001。

2 实现过程
先实现一个神经网络，再进行增加一个BP算法

My father likes fishing, so we often go fishing with the whole family. When my father is doing fishing work, my brother and I will catch some small shrimps and fish next to him, even though his fishing level is not good, But he still likes this activity very much, because he is not only going to go fishing there, but also a way to build relationships with us. When fishing, we often sit together and chat, or sit quietly and watch surrounding scenery, and then discussing some trivial matters in life, or some small topics,and he will often teach us some principles of life, although now because of work or school, we can’t do this often, but when I think of it, I feel very warm.
